Description of the Problem:
	This program is going to define a preparatory class that you will be using 
	for linked list.  You are going to write this class and use it so that you 
	will be ready to use it for the linked list class.  The class is going to 
	be the Node class.


Class Name: Node
	The inventory class contains only the members associated with the inventory
	which are part number, item, quantity, price, and total cost.

Data:		
			- (string) mBookTitle: The title of a book
			- (string) mAuthor: The author of the book
			- (int) mDateRead: contains numerical value of the date in the 
				format of MMDDYYYY
			- (Node) *mNextNode: Pointer to next node in list

Constructors:	
			+ Node() - Sets the value to default
			+ Node(string title, string author, int date): creates node with the
				arguments passed
				
Mutator Functions:
			+ setPointer
			
Accessor Functions:
			+ getPointer
			+ getBookTitle
			+ getAuthor
			
Functions:
			+ CompareData(string title) - compare a given book title against the
				one in the class.
				Input Parms: string title - The title to be compared
				Output Parms: returns numeric value depending on the 
					lexigraphic ordering
				Returns: (int) -1 if title < mBookTitle, 0 if title == mBookTitle,
					1 if title > mBookTitle.
				> Compare string and return value based on result
				
			+ ProcessData() - Print the data to the screen
				Input Parms: None
				Output Parms: Data printed to screen
				> Print title
				> Print author
				> Print formatted date
